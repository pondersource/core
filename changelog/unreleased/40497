Change: Delete action is removed from sharing sections

In the files apps, the "shared with others" and "shared by link" sections
allowed people to use a delete action on a file or folder present in that
list. This was causing problems because people accidentally removed the
folder when, in fact, they wanted to unshare it.

This delete action isn't present any longer. You can unshare from those
views by accessing the file or folder's details. If you want to delete
the file or folder, you can do it from the regular "all files" section.
