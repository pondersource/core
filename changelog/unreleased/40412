Bugfix: "available for" in the mount point configuration will show displaynames

The "available for" select of the mount configuration of external storages
were using the group id. This wasn't a problem because for local groups the
group id matches the group displayname, and for ldap groups the group id was
the "cn" attribute.
Due to recent changes, the ldap group will now use the objectuid attribute
(or a similar attribute) as group id by default. This was causing the "available
for" select to show that objectuid, so identifying the right group was problematic.

Now, the "available for" select will show the group displayname, which for
ldap is the "cn" attribute by default.

Note that this happens on new installations. There is an automatic migration
in place, so for upgrades, the "cn" attribute will be set as groupname in order
to keep the old behavior
