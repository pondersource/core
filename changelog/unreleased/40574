Enhancement: Add support for login policies

Support for login policies has been added in order to block
the login of users under some circumstances. By default, there
isn't any restriction, so any user can login normally (assuming
the password is correct)

A group login policy has been added. This policy allows or denies
the user from login based on the login type being used by the user
(username + password, openidconnect, etc) and whether he belongs
to specific groups. This can be used to ensure a group of users
are always authenticated using a determined authentication
mechanism.
