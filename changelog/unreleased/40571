Bugfix: Fix the dav:cleanup-chunks command to work with a configured folder

The ownCloud's FS was initialized partially to prevent contacting the LDAP
server if it was configured. This was causing problems because the upload
folder where the chunks were expected was a mountpoint, and due to the
partial FS initialization such mountpoint was missing, so we were checking
a different folder (the default one).

Now, the ownCloud's FS will be fully initialized instead, so the mountpoint
will be present and we check the right location.
