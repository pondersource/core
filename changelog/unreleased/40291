Bugfix: Properly remove file versions from the trashbin

Previously, restoring or removing a file from inside a folder
that was deleted (so the folder and the contents are in the
trashbin) didn't remove the versions of the file. Those versions
were left in both the DB and the FS, taking space and degrading
the performance.

This is now being handled properly, so no additional resource
is consumed due to the versions being left stranded.
