Bugfix: Apps requiring SAML/SSO session now load correctly at first page

Apps that require session to load some content at request start, could not be loaded due 
to missing SAML/SSO session objects that could only be obtained after the app loaded or at next visited page
when that object was correctly persisted. Now, after handling apache backend session, auth success 
confirmation page is shown that redirects to the owncloud landing page.
