Bugfix: Ensure user's directory is always present

There are some scenarios where the user's directory might not be created.
This leads to a state where the user can't upload any file, so the admin
might need to remove the account and create a new one.

While this scenario might still happen, we're now ensuring that the
user's directory is created at some point, so the user can upload files
into his account at any time.
