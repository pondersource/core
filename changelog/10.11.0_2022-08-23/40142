Change: Improve visualization of author's comment in the comments section

Previously, a long display name for the author's comment could overlap
with the "edit" action and the date. Worst case, the comment might not be
edited because the "edit" action was below the author's display name, so
you might not be able to click the action.

Right now, the author's display name won't overlap with the rest of the
elements. The display name will be cut if needed, but both the "edit"
action and the date will be clearly visible.
