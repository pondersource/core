Bugfix: Use group's displayname in the user's profile and user list

Previously, the group id was being used in both the user's profile and
the user list. This hasn't been important because the local groups have
matching group id and displayname, the same for ldap groups.

Due to recent changes with the ldap app (version 0.17.0), the group
id and the displayname could be different, and they'll be different
by default in the ldap app.

In both the user's profile and the user list, the group id was being used
instead of the displayname. This is fixed now, and the displayname will
be used as intended.
