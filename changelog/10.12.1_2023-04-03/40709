Bugfix: Prevent 507 Insufficient Storage on 32-bit systems

With the introduction of https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40567 compatibility to 32-bit systems broke as we are now casting $freeSpace to int and this caused an integer overflow on such systems when the free space was above the max supported value. We added therefore an additional check for 32-bit systems in QuotaPlugin.php.
