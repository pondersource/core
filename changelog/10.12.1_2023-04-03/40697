Bugfix: Add rewrite base to .htaccess

In previous core versions the rewrite base config.php option was not added to
the generated .htaccess file. The use of a more hardened .htaccess file in version
10.12.0 (being introduced by https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/40584) caused the
files view in the web UI to be empty in URL via subfolder plus index.php-less
setups. Additionally, the desktop app was not be able to sync and an error 405
(Method not allowed) was returned. Rewrite base is now correctly added to the
.htaccess file.
